zenithia_calinore,SHIP," The Legendary ""Calinore Class Expeditionary Survey Vessel"", a true Leviathan of the Domain Era, a grand survey vessel that was operated by the Domain Explorarium as a manned support to the standard wave of automated motherships and probes, ensuring local manned oversight and security. These vessels built with extensive cargo bays and large fuel reserves, can conduct independent operations for tens of cycles. Each vessel equipped with cutting edge advanced sensor suites, giving them better sensor strength and range than entire combined fleets, also ensuring a high sensor profile, unable to hide and with its mass unable to run. Thus it comes with a swath of hybridized modular weapon slots across its breath, meant to protect from possible roving frontier pirates or rouge bands of ""dissidents"", the standard legal loadouts being simply enough point defense to rip an Onslaught to shreds.
 
""Now go, oh Grand Calinore of Calinore, go forth to those Distant Brilliant Stars beyond, across the Great Void which we dare stare, pave the way for those that haul the Gates of Life, and bring it into Man's Domain."" 
- Inscribed on the hull and interior in places of prominence.

""It is said that those of Man on the surface of that old cradle of Earth, so primitive and fractured, looked to the sky and the very stars beyond in the darkness, dreaming to reach, dreaming to make them his Domain, and now so many cycles later, Man's Domain has grown from that of land, that of sea, that of sky, and even the worlds beyond, now to the stars themselves, but yet further stars lay beyond, so it is the great mission of the Domain Explorarium to bring them into Man's ever reaching Domain, and it's now in our time of Zenith of Domain, of the Explorarium, in Zenithia Domainia.

That we have taken man's ambition and turned it to the great work of the Explorarium with the manufacture of the Grand vessels of Calinore, the Grand ""Calinore Class Expeditionary Survey Vessel"" of the Domain of Man Explorarium, the DMES Glory of Man, the DMES Children of Sol, the DMES Calinore herself and so many others yet out there and yet to come, boasting brave Explorarium crews in the tens of thousands, carrying more supplies than Atlas could hold a hundred times over, more fuel than a Prometheus's hubris, enough armaments and craft to give an Onslaught pause, it goes forth into that yet to be Man's Domain, no gates of Man giving life nor direction, for cycles they expand Man's Domain with the Explorarium's great Motherships and her children. 

And nought they return till the first gate is hauled and with its opening brings life, the Domain of Man, the Zenithia Domainia, and it is thus we have the ever rising zenith of the Domain of Man, for his vessels seed the stars, and his gates give them life, we are Zenithia Domainia, the Zenith of the Domain and its brilliant blinding future.
- Zenithia Domainia AD for the Domain Explorarium and Calinore class in Cycle 2,000 of Man's Domain.

Now over 200 Cycles later of Man's fallen domain, the Gates of claimed life never open shut, the Domain's fate an existential question, yet still the Calinore Braves that Void, enduring the chaos of a Man so Fallen, enduring the hyperspace storms between those now Forsaken Stars, across the cascades of barren Earths, and ports of safety so few, yet still daring to stare into the abyssal beyond demanding it stares back as it plows through, like those of it, it is named for, having become one with the soul of Man that molded its hull and crew it with life, taking their hopes, taking their light and darkness in equal measure, the Calinore still standing proud to its name and mission, its unyielding spirit undaunted, where once it served to expand Man's Domain over the kingdom of creation, that of Zenithia Domainia now no longer, Calinore's fate uncertain in the once familiar stars of Orion, yet Now, now it serves to rebirth it anew.
